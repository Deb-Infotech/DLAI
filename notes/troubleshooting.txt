Steps to solve pytest not detected by pycharm 
1. pytests was getting installed on root directory not pytest directory
Started Fresh -
1. Deleted .venv folder
2. uninstalled uv from root python or %appdata% folder
3. activated .venv from commandline - py -m venv .venv
4. .venv\Scripts\activate.bat [(.venv) should appear in front of path]
5. uv init (created pyproject.toml with project name = foldername)
5. uv add playwright pytest pytest-playwright requests
6. pycharm was able to find pytest now
